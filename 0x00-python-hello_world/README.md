# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Description
This project introduces basic Python programming concepts. The tasks include writing and executing Python scripts, string manipulation, and understanding Python's syntax and style guide (PEP8 / PyCodeStyle).

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the origins of Python and its creator, Guido van Rossum.
- Explain the meaning of the 'Zen of Python'.
- Use the Python interpreter.
- Print text and variables using the `print` function.
- Use string indexing and slicing.
- Follow Python's official coding style using `pycodestyle`.

## Requirements
- All scripts are executed using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code must adhere to `pycodestyle`.
- Files must be executable.

## Tasks

### 0. Run Python File
- **File:** `0-run`
- Write a Shell script that runs a Python script using the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### 1. Run Inline
- **File:** `1-run_inline`
- Write a Shell script that runs Python code stored in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

### 2. Hello, print
- **File:** `2-print.py`
- Write a Python script that prints exactly:
  ```
  "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
  ```

### 3. Print Integer
- **File:** `3-print_number.py`
- Print an integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`.
- Use f-strings (`f"{number} Battery street"`).

### 4. Print Float
- **File:** `4-print_float.py`
- Print a float variable `number` with 2 decimal places using f-strings.

### 5. Print String
- **File:** `5-print_string.py`
- Print a string stored in `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters.

### 6. Play with Strings
- **File:** `6-concat.py`
- Concatenate two strings `str1` and `str2` to print `Welcome to ALX!`.

### 7. Copy - Cut - Paste
- **File:** `7-edges.py`
- Extract parts of a string:
  - `word_first_3`: first 3 letters.
  - `word_last_2`: last 2 letters.
  - `middle_word`: word excluding first and last letters.

### 8. Create a New Sentence
- **File:** `8-concat_edges.py`
- Modify a given string to print `object-oriented programming with Python`.

### 9. Easter Egg
- **File:** `9-easter_egg.py`
- Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

### 10. Linked Lists Cycle (Advanced)
- **File:** `10-check_cycle.c, lists.h`
- Write a function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle.
