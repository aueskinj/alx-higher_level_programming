# Python - Import & Modules

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Python - Import & Modules** project! This project will guide you through the fundamental concepts of importing functions, creating modules, using built-in functions, and handling command-line arguments in Python. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how Python manages modules and scripts.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Import functions from another file.
- Use imported functions effectively.
- Create and utilize Python modules.
- Use the built-in function `dir()`.
- Prevent unintended script execution when importing modules.
- Handle command-line arguments in Python programs.

## Project Structure
This project consists of several tasks designed to strengthen your understanding of Python imports and modules. Below is a summary of key tasks:

### Tasks
#### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
- Write a script that imports the function `add(a, b)` from `add_0.py`.
- Print the result of `1 + 2` in the format: `1 + 2 = 3`.
- Ensure only one reference to `add_0` in your script.

#### 1. My first toolbox!
- Import functions from `calculator_1.py`.
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Print results using only four `print()` statements.

#### 2. How to make a script dynamic!
- Write a script that prints the number and list of command-line arguments.
- Handle cases where no arguments are provided.
- Format the output to display each argument's position.

#### 3. Infinite addition
- Write a script that adds all command-line arguments.
- Handle large numbers correctly.
- Ensure proper casting of input values to integers.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All code must run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using Python **3.8.5**.
- All files should end with a new line.
- First line of all scripts: `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code must adhere to **pycodestyle (version 2.8.0)**.
- All scripts must be executable.
- Each file's length will be checked using `wc`.

## Repository Details
- **GitHub Repository**: `alx-higher_level_programming`
- **Directory**: `0x02-python-import_modules`
- **Mandatory Files**:
  - `0-add.py`
  - `1-calculation.py`
